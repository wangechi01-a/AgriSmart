# AgriSmart
## Overview
AgriSmart is an innovative project designed to tackle food insecurity In Kenya by leveraging modern technologies in agriculture. The project focuses on enhancing farming practices, optimizing crop yield, and improving food distribution systems. It aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger, aiming to end hunger, ensure access to nutritious food, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

## Objective
The primary objective of the AgriSmart project is to optimize agricultural practices through data-driven decision-making, empowering local farmers to increase productivity, reduce waste, and improve food distribution. The project also aims to enhance food security by providing actionable insights on crop management, soil quality, and resource allocation, thereby contributing to the fight against hunger in vulnerable Kenyan Communities.

## Solution
AgriSmart delivers a comprehensive platform that integrates advanced machine learning algorithms with agricultural data to support decision-making. The solution offers the following features:

- Data-Driven Crop Management: Utilizes machine learning models to predict optimal planting and harvesting periods based on climate, soil, and water conditions.
- Resource Optimization: Provides recommendations for efficient resource allocation (e.g., water, fertilizers) to maximize crop yield and minimize waste.
- Market Insights: Offers real-time market data to help farmers make informed decisions regarding crop sales, reducing the risk of overproduction or underproduction.
- Early Warning System: Incorporates predictive models to detect potential pest outbreaks or weather anomalies, allowing farmers to take preventive action.
  
## Technologies Used
- Machine Learning Frameworks: For predictive modeling and optimization.
- Data Visualization: Tableau and Seaborn for creating clear and actionable insights.
- Big Data Tools: Used for handling large agricultural datasets and making data-driven predictions.
- Python: For data cleaning, feature engineering, and model development.
- Cloud Platforms: For scalability and real-time data processing, ensuring the solution is accessible to farmers across different regions.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
